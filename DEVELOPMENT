To check code changes on your Thunderbird only with thunderbird restart:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Thunderbird/Building_a_Thunderbird_extension_7%3A_Installation

To see the debug messages of the plugin you need two things:
1. Change the AutomaticDictionary.dump code to enable dumps (See ad.js)
2. Set the thunderbird preferences (in the profile) to allow dumps (look at goole)
