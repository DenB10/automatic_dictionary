# Collecting data on AutomaticDictionarySwitcher Thunderbird addon #

This information is provided to inform the users about the data collecting process that
the plugin performs.

## Why? ##

To improve on next versions. I ,the developer, need to see how people are using the
plugin and be able to detect when the plugin fails and see why.

**I will not provide personal information to anyone. Privacy is a must for me and 
I want the same to the others.**

## Which data? ##

We are collecting anonymous data and events like:
* When you configure a language for a group of recipients.
* When the plugin fails to detect a language.
* When the plugin gets the language right.
* When the plugin guesses the language based on heuristics.
* When you send an email.
* How many mail-language assignments  have you saved.
* Your plugin settings (max size, etc).
* How much it lasts to do the operations like loading configuration or preparing data for heuristics.
* When you are using this plugin with Conversations.
* GoogleAnalytics traditional data like operating system, language of the operating system, country, etc.

We DO NOT collect:
* Mail addresses
* Mail bodies
* Any other personal data that is not mentioned in the previous list.



**These statements can be checked by any developer as this plugin is open source**

_If anyone wants to check, look on the ad.js where it says "collect"._
