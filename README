== Automatic dictionary extension for Thunderbird ==

=== Target ===
  Users that write emails in diferent languages very often to the same addresses each
  time.

  When writing a new email or answering one, get the dictionary language correctly
  setted.
  
  The extension will keep a record of the language previously selected for the
  recipients of the mail and switch it.
  
  
=== Usage ===
  
  To associate a language to a recipient:
   * Go to "Compose message"
   * Write it's address in the TO field
   * Choose the language you want to assign
     * There will apear a message on the status bar announcing that that language
       has been assigned to a recipient.
  
  You can assign various recipients at once, setting them all to the language.
  
  Caution, the plugin only assigns the languages to the recipients when the
  language is changed, so if the laguage set by default is the one you want to
  assign to the users, you'll have to change the language to any other, wait the
  extension to register that (the status bar will change), and then set the target
  language.
  
  
  Once a language is setted to a user, each time you Compose a message and that
  recipient appears in the "TO" recipients, the language will be set to that.
  

=== TODO ===

   * Don't do polling but listening to events
   * Detect based on text:
      In case no previous data is avaliable or there is not a unique language for the
      recipients, the extension can try to guess it based on the misakes that appear
      aplying the most used dictionaries.
