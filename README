== Automatic dictionary extension for Thunderbird ==

=== Target ===
  Users that write emails in different languages very often to the same addresses each
  time.

  When writing a new email or answering one, get the dictionary language correctly
  set.
  
  The extension will keep a record of the language previously selected for the
  recipients of the mail and switch it.

  It can also guess the language based on the domain of the recipients of the mail.
  
  
=== Usage ===
  
  To associate a language to a recipient:
   * Go to "Compose message"
   * Write it's address in the TO field
   * Choose the language you want to assign
     * There will appear a message on the status bar announcing that that language
       has been assigned to a recipient.
  
  You can assign various recipients at once, setting them all to the language.
  
  Caution, the plugin only assigns the languages to the recipients when the
  language is changed, so if the language set by default is the one you want to
  assign to the users, you'll have to change the language to any other, wait the
  extension to register that (the status bar will change), and then set the target
  language.
    
  Once a language is set to a user, each time you Compose a message and that
  recipient appears in the "TO" or "CC" recipients, the language will be set to that.
  

=== Development plan ===

 Version 2.x
    -> Detect based on text
      In case no previous data is available or there is not a unique language for the
      recipients, the extension can try to guess it based on the mistakes that appear
      applying the most used dictionaries.
