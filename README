== Automatic dictionary extension for Thunderbird ==

=== Target ===
  Users that write emails in diferent languages very often to the same addresses each
  time.

  When writing a new email or answering one, get the dictionary language correctly
  setted.
  
  The extension will keep a record of the language previously selected for the
  recipients of the mail and switch it.
  
  
=== Usage ===
  
  To associate a language to a recipient:
   * Go to "Compose message"
   * Write it's address in the TO field
   * Choose the language you want to assign
     * There will apear a message on the status bar announcing that that language
       has been assigned to a recipient.
  
  You can assign various recipients at once, setting them all to the language.
  
  Caution, the plugin only assigns the languages to the recipients when the
  language is changed, so if the laguage set by default is the one you want to
  assign to the users, you'll have to change the language to any other, wait the
  extension to register that (the status bar will change), and then set the target
  language.
  
  
  Once a language is setted to a user, each time you Compose a message and that
  recipient appears in the "TO" recipients, the language will be set to that.
  


=== Known issues ===

  * Concurrency issues as the spellchecking service language is shared among
    all the compose windows. So when you change the lang on one of them, all
    them change and the AD registers the new lang for all recipients in all
    windows.

=== TODO ===

  - Replace observing for listeners: listen to spellcheck changes and to recipients
    addition.
        - Observe addressingWidget (recipients)
        - Observe languageMenuList (language change)
  - Allow/apply i18n
  - Limit the number of recipients registered to a max, to avoid having a big
    hash saved.
  - Detect based on text:
      In case no previous data is avaliable or there is not a unique language for the
      recipients, the extension can try to guess it based on the misakes that appear
      aplying the most used dictionaries.
  
=== Development plan ===

    -> Replace observing for recipients

 Version 0.8.2
    -> i18n support
